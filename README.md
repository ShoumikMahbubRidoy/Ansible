# Ansible: Simplifying IT Automation

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is like a helpful robot for IT tasks. It can do many things automatically, such as setting up software, managing servers, and more. It's open source, meaning it's free for anyone to use.

## How Ansible Works

Ansible doesn't need special software on the computers it's working with. It uses a simple language called YAML to give it instructions. YAML looks like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Example Task
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
```
In this example, Ansible is instructed to install the Apache web server on machines in the "web_servers" group.

## Agentless Approach
Unlike some other automation tools, Ansible doesn't need to install anything on the computers it's managing. It connects to them using SSH, like how you might log in remotely to a computer

## Playbooks
Ansible instructions are organized into something called "playbooks." Think of a playbook like a script that tells Ansible what to do. Here's an example of a simple playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Web Server
  hosts: web_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
    - name: Start Apache Service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
```
In this playbook, Ansible will install Apache and start the Apache service on the computers in the "web_servers" group.

## Multi-Tier Deployment
Ansible is good at managing many computers that work together. For example, it can set up a web server, a database server, and connect them properly. Imagine you're building a house. Instead of focusing on just one brick at a time, Ansible helps you see the whole structure and how the bricks fit together.

## Inventory
Ansible keeps track of the computers it manages in something called an "inventory." An inventory is like a list of computers and groups of computers. Here's a simple example:

```yaml
web_servers:
  192.168.1.10
  192.168.1.11

db_servers:
  192.168.1.12
```
In this inventory, we have two groups: "web_servers" and "db_servers," and each group has the IP addresses of the computers.

So, Ansible makes IT tasks easier by using plain text instructions (YAML playbooks), connecting to computers remotely without needing special software, and helping manage multiple computers working together. It's like having a friendly robot to handle repetitive tasks and ensure your IT systems run smoothly.

# Ansible Hosts File: Managing Your Server Inventory

## What is a Hosts File in Ansible?

In Ansible, the hosts file is like a contact list that tells Ansible which computers it should manage and how to connect to them. Each computer is referred to as a "host." Here's an example of a simple hosts file:

```yaml
# File name: hosts
# Description: Inventory file for your application. Defines machine type abc node to deploy specific artifacts.
# Defines machine type def node to upload metadata.

[abc-node]
server1 ansible_host=<target machine for DU deployment> ansible_user=<Ansible user> ansible_connection=ssh

[def-node]
server2 ansible_host=<target machine for artifact upload> ansible_user=<Ansible user> ansible_connection=ssh
